          <p>Chickens are domestic or farm birds. The live span of a chicken is about 10 to 15
            years.
            The male is larger and more brightly colored than the female. This is common feature in birds. The males
            show off their colorful feathers to attract the females.
            A chicken has a comb on the head and two wattles under the neck. The male has a larger comb compared to
            the female. The male is called a rooster. The female is called a hen while the young are called chicks. The
            female is usually ready to lay her first eggs when she is around six months old.</p>

          <p>Cow, in common parlance, a domestic bovine, regardless of sex and age, usually of the
            species Bos taurus.
            In precise usage, the name is given to mature females of several large mammals, including cattle (bovines),
            moose, elephants, sea lions, and whales.
            Domestic cows are one of the most common farm animals around the world, and the English language has
            several words to describe these animals at various ages. A baby cow is called a calf. A female calf is
            sometimes
            called a heifer calf and a male a bull calf.</p>

          <h3 class="text-center">Sushi</h3>
          <p>The history of sushi began with Paddy Fields in Asia, where fish was fermented with
            rice vinegar, salt and rice, after which the rice was discarded. The dish is today known as narezushi, and
            was introduced to Japan around the Yayoi period.[1] In the Muromachi period, people began to eat the rice as
            well as the
            fish.
            During the Edo period, vinegar rather than fermented rice began to be used. In pre-modern times and
            modern times, it has become a form of fast food strongly associated with Japanese culture.</p>
